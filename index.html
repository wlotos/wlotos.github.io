	<h1>Hello users</h1>
	<p>This is <span>WLOTOS</span> game. This game is intended for all Internet users. You have to decrypt several messages in this game. Ultimately, you can find the right path and join the ranks of hackers, in the private channel of Utopia. I wish you all good luck. Assignments will come out gradually. In each of them you will find the <span>release date</span> of the new task in encrypted form.</p>
